This repository shows a few C# tests that use the page object model and AltUnityTester to test the Unity endless runner sample:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/endless-runner-sample-game-87901

### Running the tests on iOS
`./ios_tests.sh`

This script will:

- start the app on your device
- run the tests
- stop the app after the test are done
